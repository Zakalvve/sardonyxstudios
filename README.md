# [Sardonxy Studios Portfolio Site](https://sardonyx-studios.netlify.app)
I created this site to serve as a platform for promoting myself and my coding abilities. As time goes on I hope to add to and improve this site as my skill improves.

This site was primarily created using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
